through its most crucial years. Dr. M.S. Ramaiah also identified and brought in

professionals of impeccable character, qualification and qualities,

encouraging them to participate in the institution’s growth, a move that

contributed significantly to our success all along. As we celebrate our Golden

Jubilee, we wish to offer our grateful thanks to all those who contributed in

their various capacities to help us achieve this stature.

Post the demise of Dr. M.S. Ramaiah in 1997, MSRIT has been ably led by his

heirs, led by the current Chairman Dr. M.R. Jayaram who took over the helm.

Under his guidance, MSRIT has seen significant investments in infrastructure

At MSRIT we believe in the holistic development of students in a way
that they evolve into full-fledged and confident professionals by the
time they graduate. This can be made possible by encouraging them to
engage in various extra-curricular activities such as music, theatre,
literary, visual and fine arts, apart from sports, NSS and other similar
pursuits.
Extra-curricular activities are not just about entertainment, they help
molding the personality of the students in the following ways:
Enhancing soft skills such as communication skills, etiquette and
confidence levels.
Helping them in the areas of time management, emotion
management, success (and failure) management, crisis management
and more importantly people management.
While good grades equip students to get their first jobs,
extra-curricular activities equip students with skills for their whole
lives.
They help inculcating in students, values such as empathy,
broad-mindedness, team-spirit, self-control, ethics, acceptance of
pluralities in society, corporate social responsibility, and so on.
MSRIT is the only college to have a separate department for cultural
activities, known as the Department of Extra-Curricular Activities
(DECA). There are 21 Student-driven Clubs active on campus under the
guidance and direction of DECA. Apart from Cultural Activities there are
Clubs which involve themselves in Finance, Japanese culture, Gaming,
Video-editing, Photography, etc. There are hosts of activities throughout

India level Quiz and Debate Competitions, Shoutout (an exclusive
intra-mural Theatre competitions), Kannada Rajyotsava, TEDx MSRIT,
UDBHAV (inter-collegiate Cultural Festival), etc. Please join and
discover yourselves!

RAMAIAH EVOLUTE
Ramaiah Evolute is the product of a vision to create and
nurture innovative unmatched entrepreneurship skills in the
country. To make this vision tangible, the Ramaiah Group of
Institutions decided to set up a novel innovative start-up
infrastructure centre at its University campus, aided by a
strong mentoring team. The objective was to create a
unique holistic environment to incubate start-ups where
basic to intelligent infrastructure and essential services
along with industry focused mentoring and funding is
available.
Ramaiah Evolute will incidentally be the first
cross-disciplinary start-up ecosystem in the country,
leveraging successfully on the access to 11 diverse
academic disciplines in the campus. Setting up this
ecosystem in a multi-disciplinary campus also precludes
the conventional hurdles faced in innovation such as lack of
holistic domain and application expertise and
understanding of industry from a business, technology and
standards perspective.
Bengaluru, November 9, 2022: The Ramaiah Group of
Institutions, as part of its Ramaiah Evolute program, gave
away the Star Start-up Awards to 18 selected start-ups that
were picked for recognition after a gruelling process of
selection from an extensive number of applicants across
the country. The Star Start-up Award is in line with the
Group’s vision of recognising and encouraging innovation
and coming up with products and processes using next
generation technology while giving a fillip to emerging
entrepreneurs.
The 18 Star Start-ups were recognised for their incredible
innovative spirit and techniques, the clean green technology
solutions offered, the sustainable features of the products and
processes developed and the diverse domains that they
related to where some of them entered into segments that
were direly needed but had so far seen negligible or nil
ventures. Also, there was showcasing of the selected startups
from Evolute Cohorts 1 & 2 to an elite panel of investors.
The 18 selected start-ups received the award certificates of
recognition and citations from Mr M R Jayaram. The Star
Start-up Award is part of the initiative of the Ramaiah Group to
recognise the best cross disciplinary start-ups using high
technology and high level of innovation where the end product
or process has a significant impact on society.
