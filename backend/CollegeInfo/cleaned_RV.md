### 4.0 EVALUATION SYSTEM

## 4.1 ASSESSMENT TESTING

```
a) Assessment testing will be done in two parts as follows, both of them being
important in assessing the student achievement:
```

```
(i) Sessional, involving Continuous Internal Evaluation (CIE) will be conducted by
the course teacher all through the semester. The evaluation process has three
parts, executed by way of Quizzes (Q), Tests (T) and Assignment (A). The evaluation
of assignment could be descriptive / analytical type assessment spread throughout
the semester, weekly/fortnightly assignments, problem solving, group discussions
and seminars depending on the course. CIE could also be evaluated by
experiential learning, collaborative learning, project-based learning, problem-based
learning, web-based learning, game-based learning, computer-support
collaborative learning, mobile assisted learning and seamless puzzle-based
learning. The tests have to be written in the official booklets. It is the student's
responsibility to see and confirm the evaluation and marks obtained after each
test. After ascertaining that he/she has obtained the marks as per the
performance, the student shall sign in the blue book after each test.
```

```
(ii) Terminal Examination designated as Semester End Examination (SEE) will be
conducted jointly with an external examiner. This will include a written
examination for theory courses and practical/design examination including viva-
voce for laboratory / design courses. Controller of Examinations (CoE) in
coordination with Dean Academics, and Board of Examiners implements the SEE
process.
```

1. CIE and SEE will have **EQUAL (50:50) WEIGHTAGE.**
2. A student’s performance in a course is judged by considering the performance in
   both CIE and SEE.
3. The course load of 20- 26 credits per semester is being followed as per the
   recommendation of BoS and Academic Council.
4. In the credit system, both CIE and SEE will have equal (50:50) weightage. A
   student's performance in a course is judged by considering the performance in
   both CIE and SEE.
5. The marks obtained by the student in CIE will be displayed in the respective
   departments and the students are expected to affix their signatures during a
   prescribed period as confirmation of their verification of the marks.
6. The number of credits is clearly defined in the scheme of study. All the students
   are required to compulsorily register for all the courses prescribed for regular
   semester.

7. Faculty Advisors / Counselors will monitor the student's CIE performance; take
   necessary further steps to advice the student accordingly. As a follow up of this,
   each student will be advised to continue with the average load/credits, drop of
   courses or withdraw from them **as indicated in section 3.2.**
8. Students shall be allowed to choose the elective/s, depending on their career
   plans, and there shall not be any restriction on the minimum number of students
   to be registered for an elective course.

## TABLE 19 GRADING SYSTEM

```
Absolute Grading system on 10-point scale is followed in the evaluation of student's
performance in a course.
a) LETTER GRADES: Letter grade is basically a qualitative measure (an
alphabet/letter) giving the performance of a student, such as, Outstanding ( O) ,
Excellent (A+) , Very Good (A) , Good (B+) , Above Average (B) , Average (C), Pass (P)
and Fail (F) , based on the score. This is arrived at after the student's performance in
a course, which includes both CIE and SEE.
```

```
b) The range of marks for each letter grade shall be as given in the following Table 19.
```

```

c) **GRADE POINTS:** Depending on the letter grades assigned, a student earns certain
grade points. In the 10-point grading system, the grade points earned for different
letter grades are given in **Table 19**.
d) Grade point averages SGPA and CGPA: The grade points earned for each course are
used further for calculating semester grade point average (SGPA) and the cumulative
grade point average (CGPA), both of which being important performance indices of
the student.
(i) **SGPA** (Semester Grade Point Average) is the performance index of a student in
a semester and is calculated as follows:

The SGPA and CGPA respectively facilitate the declaration of academic performance of a
student at the end of the semester and the end of successive semesters respectively).
```

```
e) Transitional Grades: The transitional grades, such as ’ I ’, ' W ' and ' X ' shall be
awarded to a student in the following cases. These shall be converted into one or
the other of the letter grades ( O-F ) after student completes his/ her course
requirements, including examinations.
```

**Grade 'I':** Awarded to a student having satisfactory attendance at classes and
meeting the passing standard at CIE in a course, but remained absent from SEE for
valid and convincing reasons acceptable to the college, like
(i) Severe illness or accidents, which disable him/her from attending SEE.

```
(ii) A calamity in the family at the time of SEE, which required the student to be
away from the college. The candidate or the parents should inform the
incident to the Chief Superintendent of Examination before the
commencement of particular examination. The documents related to the
incident shall be submitted to the Controller of Examinations within a week’s
time from the date of that particular examination or last day of that particular
even/ odd semester examination, whichever is earlier.
```

```
(iii) Any other exigency which the Grading Advisory Committee thinks requires
consideration, like a student representing the institution / state / university
/ nation in university / state / national / international level events /
competition. In such cases, the student is required to take prior permission
from Head of the institution with relevant documents. The student should
also submit the proof of having attended the event / competition immediately
after returning, without which the transitional grade will not be considered.
IF the student does not submit the relevant documents that support the
claim of the candidate to abstain from the examination if not submitted
within the prescribed period, such applications are liable to be rejected for I
grade. The grading advisory committee’s decision regarding the awarding of
the I grade is final.
```

```
GRADE 'W': Awarded to a student having satisfactory attendance at classes but
withdrawing from that course before the prescribed date in a semester under the
advice of counselor and HoD, forwarded to the Dean Academics for approval.
```

```
GRADE 'X': Awarded to a student having attendance (> = 85%) and CIE rating
(>= 90%) in a course, but SEE performance observed to be ‘F’, which could result in
an overall F grade in the course.
```

```
f) EARNING CREDIT: A Student would be considered to have completed a course
successfully and earned the credits, if he/she secures a letter grade other than
NSAR, NSSR, NE I, W, X or F in that course. Grade F in any course implies failure
in that course.
```

## 4.5 PASSING STANDARDS

a) The Standard of passing in each course is given in the following Table 20

## TABLE 20 PASSING STANDARDS

b) **There shall be no re-examination for any course in the credit system** to take

## EXAMINATIONS. 4.8 PAPER VIEWING PROCESS (PVP) APPLICABLE TO ALL SEE EXCEPT LAB

**examinations.**
Paper Viewing Process (PVP) has been implemented for both UG and PG programs. After
the provisional results are announced, the candidate can view his/her SEE answer
scripts. The candidate shall register for PVP and during PVP he/she can give his/her
grievance in writing in the prescribed format. Then the answer scripts evaluated once
again based on the grievance of the student by an expert committee. Paper viewing
process is final and this eliminates issue of Photostat copying of answer scripts, re-
valuation and challenge valuation.

**PVP INVOLVES THE FOLLOWING STEPS
STEP – I: REGISTRATION FOR PVP**
The registration dates will be announced by the CoE office once the provisional results
have been announced. For each course/s for which the student wishes to verify the
answer script, the student needs to register for the course in the prescribed format.

**STEP – II: SCHEDULE FOR PVP**
The schedule to view the answer scripts will be announced and the student should be
present personally to view the answer scripts. During this time, the student will be

provided with a grievance form along with the evaluated answer script with marks
awarded, scheme of valuation and solution. The students should provide the specific
grievance question wise and only those grievances will be addressed.

- For audit courses no SEE exams.
- Condition for dropping: Only after 4 years

**STEP – III: VALUATION BY EXPERT TEAM**
The grievance forms will be verified and each answer script applied for PVP will be
evaluated by an expert team and if any change in the marks awarded is found, then
better of the marks shall be considered for final grading. No negative evaluation in PVP.

## 4.9 MALPRACTICE

A student who is booked under malpractice will be prevented from writing that
particular examination from the instant he/she is booked for malpractice ( **Possession
of manuscripts/printed material related or not related to the concerned course of

awarded with a credit of ‘0’ (Zero) with the grade ‘MP’ for the calculation of SGPA.

## 4.10 REJECTION OF RESULTS

A student is permitted to reject the results of an entire semester (including CIE) only
once during the program duration. The student, who desires to reject the performance,
shall reject performance in all the courses of the semester, irrespective of whether
he/she has passed or failed in the courses. Such a student is allowed to take re-
admission for the relevant semester. Such a student will have to represent to the

permitted to the students who have grade ‘MP’ in the respective semester until the
compliance of penalty and punishment is cleared.

## 4.11 GRADE CARDS

Each student will be issued a grade card at the end of odd and even semester as well as
fast track examinations. This will have a list of all the courses registered by the student
for the examination together with their credits, the letter grades and grade points
awarded. Only those courses registered for credit and having grade points shall be
included in the computation of the student's performance like SGPA and CGPA and the
audit courses will not form part of this computation. The result of mandatory courses,
which are of the noncredit type, will also be reflected in the grade card with appropriate
letter grades. It may be noted that each student shall have to obtain at least **grade** C **or
higher** (pass grade) **in each mandatory course to qualify for the award of degree by
the university**.

## 4.12 PERCENTAGE EQUIVALENCE OF GRADE POINTS (ON 10 POINT SCALE)

The Equivalence of CGPA with the percentage of marks to be considered for equivalence
in the conventional system for students coming from VTU colleges to autonomous

colleges is as follows:
Conversion of CGPA in to percentage of marks and class equivalence, there is no
formula for the conversion of CGPA into the percentage of marks. However, the
following table may be referred for the conversion of the CGPA on 10-point scale into
the percentage of marks for employment / higher studies, etc.
**Percentage = CGPA x 10
Example: 8.54 (CGPA)\*10 = 85.4%**

**Recommendations for Degree Award:
a) Eligibility for Passing and Award of Degree:**

- A student who obtains any grade O to C shall be considered as passed and if a
  student secures F grade in any of the head of passing, he/she has to reappear in
  that head for the SEE.
- A student shall be declared successful at the end of the Programme for the award
  of Degree only on obtaining CGPA 5.00, with none of the Courses remaining with
  F Grade.
